# Implicit and explicit attitudes toward people with physical disabilities in clinicians, rehabilitation assistants, and other occupations: material, data, and R script

This repo contains `R` scripts we compared explicit and implicit attitudes toward physical disability in clinicians, rehabilitation assistants, and individuals in other occupations using the [Physical Disability IAT dataset](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Y9HIQ), collected from 2022 to 2024 via the [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html) and made available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.

## Data
The scripts expect SAV and CSV files that are subsequently imported by `R`.

## Necessary Packages
The scripts assume/require the following packages to be installed in `R`:
- [`haven`](https://github.com/hadley/haven)
- [`here`](https://github.com/jennybc/here)
